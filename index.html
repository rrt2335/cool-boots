                    I will. Yet. What about George? Hello. McFly.
                    Doc. Yeah, it's in the back. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's
                    your new book. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your
                    answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

                    Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow
                    morning. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Yeah. No. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance
                    with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a
                    fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.
